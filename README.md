# Wiener process animated GIF with R

This post is based on [Javi Fernandez Post](http://allthiswasfield.blogspot.com/2017/12/p-margin-bottom-0.html). 

It is a modify version with a refactor functions to generate the simulated process but the overall process keeps the same core idea.

**Brownian motion** is basically an random motion of particles suspended in a liquid or gas, there is an interesting story into how it came to be [discover by botanist Robert Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAdxd2Iv-UA) and later describe by Einstein, but that is away from the scope of this humble post. 

In the original post however is not explained in detail why the use of `rnom` and the process of generating the variables, in fact I could argue that the proper title should be [Wiener Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process) instead of Brownian motion, but both of those term are correlated to each other.
